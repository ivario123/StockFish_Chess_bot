Disclaimer:

Do not under anny circumstances use this code for cheating. The only reason you should use this code is for testing chess.com bots.



Description:

A basic chess.com bot that adds some randomness as to not immediately trigger the anti cheat.


Usage:

Flip the board to diplay it from whites perspective and selecet the propper pieces and board. Klick 1 when the mouse is in the top corner of the board, klick 2 when the mouse is in the botom right corner of the board. Klick 'w' if you are playing as white, Klick 'b' if you are playing black.


Changing pieces:

Simply screenshot all of the peices and remove the background. Then replace the current images using the same names.


Changing the board:

You would need to go in to the code and change what colors are being replaced in the image. I would not recomend doing this, use the setting that is dispayed in the template image.
